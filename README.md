#### CMM (Capability Maturity Model)
CMM or the Capability Maturity Model is a methodology used within an organization to help with development and refinement of a software development process. It uses a five-level path of maturing and increasing organized processes which in turn, increase the overall quality of the development, but because of the advancement of the model, reaching each level can become a time consuming process and also can be more expensive.
