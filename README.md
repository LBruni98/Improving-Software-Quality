# Improving-Software-Quality

#### CMM (Capability Maturity Model)
CMM or the Capability Maturity Model is a methodology used within an organization to help with development and refinement of a software development process. It uses a five-level path of maturing and increasing organized processes which in turn, increase the overall quality of the development, but because of the advancement of the model, reaching each level can become a time consuming process and also can be more expensive.

#### Approaches Towards Improving Software Quality
##### Testing
One approach to improving software Quality is testing at earlier times. If the bug fixing is left towards the end of development or detected later, then it results in the bug fixing being more expensive and longer to resolve. By detecting them earlier than normal, it can help in the quality of that product being better than spending the time bug fixing later, as well as shortening development time and costs of future bug fixing.

##### Reviewing
Constant Evaluation of tasks can help with identifying areas of improvement. By just relying on what methods worked in the past doesn't mean that they will work again all of the time, but by evaulating and refactoring the tasks completed can help with maximizing efficency and help find what went well in the testing team.
